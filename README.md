# projects
As of right now, this respository only contains a few of my more interesting projects from my coursework at UC Santa Cruz.
In the near future, I hope to start adding my own projects to this repository as well.

I also participated in a group project where we created a nutritional fitness tracker app using the Swift language.

Using Unity, I created a real-time rendered 3D concert experience with a group which features raymarching and volumetric fog effects.

Along with two other developers, I built a website using React.js which hosts a marketplace for college students to exchange textbooks. https://github.com/AdarshSekar04/BookSmart
